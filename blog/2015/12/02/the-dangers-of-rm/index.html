<p>I have once caused several thousand dollars worth of damage by typing <code>rm -rf</code> absent-mindedly. Luckily, the damage was on me but the lesson was learned. I have met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTJ">ISTJ</a>-type programmers who pride themselves in always wielding the raw power of <strong>rm</strong> and who think that the Trashcan is for wusses. I respect that attitude, but to me, <strong>rm</strong> should only be applied sparingly. I find it an ill-designed human interface for quotidian usage. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve replaced it with the friendlier <code>del</code> or <code>trash</code> aliases on my system.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu</h3>

<p>Add the following aliases to your <strong>.bash-profile</strong> file:</p>

<p><code>del='gvfs-trash'</code></p>

<h3>Mac OS</h3>

<p>Install the trash command using brew:</p>

<p><code>brew install trash</code></p>
